    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> I began my life in Sri Lanka, where I spent my early childhood. Seeking new experiences and educational opportunities, I moved to Japan, where I completed my junior high school at 春日学園 in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture. This period was pivotal, shaping my perspective on discipline, innovation, and the global landscape of technology.
                           <br>
        After completing my school education in Japan, I returned to Sri Lanka, driven by a desire to contribute to my home country's growing tech industry. I enrolled at the National Institute of Business Management (NIBM), where I earned a certificate in Software Engineering. This program equipped me with foundational knowledge and skills, sparking my interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and IT business strategies.</p>
